WINDOW object and DOCUMENT object ARE NOT THE SAME!!!!!

The window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser. This window object has the majority of the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.

The document object is your html, aspx, php, or other document that will be loaded into the browser. The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.If you want to access a property for the window it is window.property, if it is document it is window.document.property which is also available in short as document.property.


An iframe actually is considered as a new window with its own document loaded into it. The original, parent window, is responsible for other windows to be loaded, not the document.

The property to access a frame is window.frames[], which is an array of all the frames. If you only have one iframe you access it by using window.frames[0]. Since the iframe is also a window object, accessing window properties of that frame is done by using window.frames[0].mywindowproperty.

Some of window Object properties:

When JavaScript is executed inside the browser, the window object is the JavaScript Global object. The document object is a property of the window object.

The window object represents the browser window.
The document object represents the HTML document loaded in that window.

The window object has many useful properties like the location object and the setTimeout function.

Since the window object is the Global object, ergo, it is the end of all scope chains, you don’t have to explicitly specify it when accessing its properties…
Instead of window.setTimeout, you can just write setTimeout

Note : when i researched about this topic there was fight among the developers that window object is global object(he refered MDN) and another one says it is not also referd a book (WROX).and he said "this book was written by Nicholas Zakas. he has a really good description of the difference between window and Global properties in his book" So i just wanna mention it.
